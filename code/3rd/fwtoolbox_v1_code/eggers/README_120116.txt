This folder contains functions for field inhomogeneity correction.

The main function is cpr.m. It implements the gridding-based field inhomogeneity 
correction described in Eggers H, Knopp T, Potts D. Field inhomogeneity correction 
based on gridding reconstruction for magnetic resonance imaging. IEEE Trans Med 
Imaging 2007; 26:374-384.

More specifically, it permits a direct, i.e. non-iterative, conjugate phase 
reconstruction-type field inhomogeneity correction, which requires (uncorrected) 
complex water and fat images, the field map, the k-space trajectory, and sampling 
density compensation weights as input and provides (corrected) complex water and 
fat images as output.

The test script test_eggers_cpr.m illustrates its use on the example of a spiral 
acquisition. It relies on complex single echo images as input, which have already 
been produced from the raw data using gridding reconstruction (the subfunction 
grid_2d may be employed for this purpose if needed) and SENSE reconstruction for 
coil combination. These complex single echo images are first separated, relying 
on Diego Hernando's software in this example (any other may be chosen instead). 
The resulting complex water and fat images, as well as the resulting field map 
then serve as input to the field inhomogeneity correction.


Some remarks:

* For the sake of simplicity, the fat is modeled as a single-peak spectrum for 
  the field inhomogeneity correction in the test script. An extension to a 
  multi-peak spectrum is straightforward, but is substantially slower processing-
  wise.

* As examples, functions for generating the k-space trajectory and the sampling 
  density compensation weights for the kind of spiral acquisition used in collecting 
  the test data set are provided (compute_constant_density_spiral_spiral_trajectory.m 
  and compute_constant_density_spiral_density.m). The field inhomogeneity correction 
  itself accepts in principle any type of k-space trajectory. 

* The subfunctions support a gridding both from a Cartesian to a non-Cartesian and 
  from a non-Cartesian to a Cartesian grid, thus facilitating an extension of the 
  provided direct conjugate phase reconstruction-type field inhomogeneity correction 
  to an iterative field inhomogeneity correction.
